Earthdowns leaderboard app built with Meteor.js

Thanks to the super [awesome guide by David Turnbull](http://meteortips.com/book/introduction/) I was able to build an Earthdowns (aka pushups) app using Meteor.js in under one day.  I highly recommend reading his guide if you want to get up and running with Meteor.
